/**
 * Every automatic action must go through the governor.
 *
 * This is the only test in the suite that reads the source instead of running it, and the reason
 * is in the changelog. Eight separate entries fix the same shape — an automatic mechanism that ran
 * without progress and could not be stopped — and each was fixed inside its own path: the failover
 * chain, the resume timer, the API-key retry, the session-limit retry, the compaction router, the
 * unclassified-refusal path, the stuck-turn watchdog, the rotation ping-pong. Every one of those
 * fixes was correct. None of them prevented the next one, because a new path that drives the
 * session is unbounded by default and only becomes safe if whoever adds it remembers to bound it.
 *
 * So the rule is enforced rather than remembered: there is a fixed, named set of places allowed to
 * drive the session, each one of them asks the governor first (or is listed here with the reason it
 * does not need to), and anything new fails this test until it does the same. A failure here is not
 * a broken test — it is a new way for the session to spin that has not been thought through yet.
